# Vehicle Application using Inheritance and Object-Oriented-Programming

  The Java Vehicle Application is an object-oriented programming project that utilizes the concept of inheritance.

  It involves implementing a system to manage different specification of cars such as wheels, doors, Gears and much more,

  Inheritance allows the creation of a base class, "Vehicle," to other classes

  with shared attributes and behaviors, which are then inherited by more specialized classes like "Car," "Wheels," 

  and "Doors." This project enables efficient code reuse and allows for easy addition of new vehicle types in the

  future. This project is a beginner level of project to inhance the knowledge about #Inheritance, #OOPs, #Java.
